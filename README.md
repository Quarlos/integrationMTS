Numerical integration using Midpoint, Trapezoidal, and Simpson's rule

Numerical integration using Midpoint, Trapezoidal, and Simpson's rule with prescribed tolerance; 
starting number of subintervals is 4; doubles until it reaches the desired tolerance 
(given by the difference of two consecutive evaluations)

INPUT: limits of integration and tolerance
Editable: the function to integrate defined as f_int(x) before main()
